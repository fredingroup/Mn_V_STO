# Mn_V_STO
all optimized supercells for Parameter Space Exploration Reveals Interesting Mn-doped STO Structures manuscript
each structure is named: supercelldescription.xyz
supercell is the number of unitcells in the xyz directions so a 2x2x3 superecell is 223
the descriptions are:
pure = bulk structure
v(atom) = vacancy of that atom
v(atom)(xyz) = vacancy of that atom in the supercell direction x, y, or z
v(twoatoms) = double vacancies
(atom)p(atom2) = atom2 subsitution at atom location
these can be combined.
in addition: (charge) = charge on the Mn dopant
